# Awesome MCP Servers [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of awesome Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, tools, SDKs, and resources.

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic that enables AI assistants like Claude to securely connect with local and remote resources. It acts as the "USB-C for AI," providing a universal way to expose tools and context to Large Language Models.
